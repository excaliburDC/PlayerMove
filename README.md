# PlayerMove
A simple player movement game with score display for each move
The game consists of a matrix with each grid containing certain numbers.
The player starts from the the first grid and the player can be moved using the movement keys w,s,a,d to go up,down,left,right respectively.
When the player moves to a new grid, the number in that grid gets added to the total score of the player and the grid gets updated with a 0 when the player makes his next move.
